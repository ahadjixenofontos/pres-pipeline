The following data set contains service request activity for Miami-Dade County. The data sets include services completed proactively by Miami-Dade County departments and requests submitted by citizens via phone (311), online (miamidade.gov), and other self service channels such as the 311Direct mobile application. With a few exceptions, the dataset does not generally include requests from other cities (City of Miami, Coral Gables, etc.) unless the work is owned by Miami-Dade County staff.

THIS DATA SET IS STILL IN BETA. Please keep that in mind as you review it.
